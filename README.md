# Wordpress Post Counter
  
Provides a shortcode to display the total number of posts on a Wordpress blog.  
  
    
Clone this repo into your Wordpress install's 'wp-content/plugins' and use the shortcode [post-counter] to have it echo out the number of posts on your site!
  
By default, the number is clickable and links to this repo. If you don't like that, you can use the shortcode [post-counter-no-attribution] instead.  
  
  
Enjoy!
